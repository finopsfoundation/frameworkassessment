# FinOps Framework Maturity Assessment

## How to use these resources
This is intended as a definition resource covering the components and concepts required in order to successfully assess and analyse the maturity levels across the entire FinOps Framework for a given target scope group.

That target scope group could be, for example: 
- A scrum team (developers)
- A functional group
- Line of business
- Department
- Business Division
- Product Team
- Service Team
- Business discipline (eg Finance)
- Entire Organisation
- ... and so on

The intent of the assessment should be to provide a cadence baseline to track progress over time, as well as an enabler to define clear roadmaps for the next cycle to target key focus areas for improvement during the next cycle. Outcomes of an assessment therefore should resolve to be:
- Standardised & consistent
- Actionable (following capability Analysis)
- Where possible, evidence-supported
