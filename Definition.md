# FinOps Framework Maturity Assessment Guide

## Introduction
As we progress with our Cloud Technology adoption roadmaps, there is another path that we must travel - if we are to truly maximise the benefits realised from that roadmap.  We must now begin our journey towards FinOps Maturity and Excellence.

As with any such journey; in order to track and plan our progress, it behoves us to know three key things:

- Where are we right now
- Where are we headed
- What do we need to do next?

Understanding our current situation leads to a clearer understanding of the key areas we must next focus closely on, in order to progress in a meaningful way.

This then is an approach designed to provide a standardised set of concepts and measurements to support that journey. These measurements can be applied at virtually all levels of an organisation, from detailed and granular specific workloads / services / functional teams, through to the macroscopic analysis of organisational divisions or entire business units. This way, we can adopt a universally understood method of tracking and guiding ourselves along the FinOps Maturity journey. 

This document will first explain the components of this assessment, then proceed to outline a method to combine understanding of the 6 assessment “Lenses”, along with the 6 Domains and 18 Capabilities of the FinOps Framework to produce actionable data and a measurable outcome.


## Scope & Intent
This assessment is not intended as an exhaustive and comprehensive analytics solution. Rather, the intent is to provide a high-level overview of the current state, whilst at the same time triggering further targeted conversations and investigation to understand that current state more deeply.
Deeper analysis on a per-capability level should be performed as needed as and when those capabilities are highlighted by this assessment. That deeper analysis is therefore outside of the scope of this initial assessment.

The implementation and specific execution of this assessment are out of scope. This definition and the examples shown are given as a reference to guide specific implementations that should be formed in line with existing business analytics approaches that are relevant to the industry being assessed.

## The 5 Assessment Lenses

The lenses defined here, when effectively applied, may provide an adequate insight into the strengths and weaknesses of a target group concerning the 18 FinOps Capabilities as defined by the FinOps Framework. Understanding each of these lenses is key to effectively applying a consistent analysis, which is critical in order to track current state over subsequent assessments. Examples of four maturity levels are given and discussed for each lens.

### Lens 1: Knowledge
`TO DO: write-up description of lens`
| Maturity | Heading | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Pre-Crawl | No Knowledge | At this level, knowledge of the capability as defined by the framework is effectively non-existent within the target group. There are no discussions happening about this capability, and nobody is actively involved in developing any further knowledge. |
| Crawl | Partial Knowledge | Preliminary knowledge of the Capability being assessed is now beginning to spread amongst key stakeholders and individuals, but the capability is not yet common knowledge across the target group. |
| Walk | Full Knowledge | Strong knowledge of the assessed capability is known throughout the target group, incorporated with starter onboarding and periodic reinforcement via training or other appropriate communication methods. |
| Run | Knowledge Leader | The target group is now driving awareness of this capability beyond itself to other peer groups and the wider industry. Leveraging deep awareness across individuals in the group, working to improve awareness and build new insights into the capability. |


### Lens 2: Process
`TO DO: write-up description of lens`
| Maturity | Heading | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Pre-Crawl | No Process | There are no described, consistent processes in place governing any aspect of the assessed capability within the target group. |
| Crawl | Implementing Process | Processes to standardise this assessed capability are being formed, defined and possibly tested. Processes are not yet formalised as BAU for the target group. |
| Walk | Working Process | Relevant, functional processes are now in place, agreed upon and being followed by at least some of the teams. |
| Run | Mature Process | Clearly defined, fully integrated processes are now universally established and adopted. Processes are being iterated on with ongoing refinement. |

### Lens 3: Metrics
`TO DO: write-up description of lens`
| Maturity | Heading | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Pre-Crawl | No Metrics | There are no measurements being taken at this point. No direct insight is available concerning the progress or current state of this capability. |
| Crawl | Basic Metrics | Initial, manually generated metrics are in place providing rudimentary traffic-light (eg: Red/Yellow/Green) measurement of this capability.|
| Walk | Established KPIs | S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely) KPIs are now in place covering at least some of this capability. |
| Run | Mature, Global KPIs | S.M.A.R.T. KPIs are now globally in place, automated and refined/iterated on with a regular cadence. Direct links to business goals. Direct link to business performance. |
### Lens 4: Adoption
`TO DO: write-up description of lens`
| Maturity | Heading | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Pre-Crawl | No Adoption | This capability is not in place anywhere within the target scope group. |
| Crawl | Initial Adoption | Early elements of this capability are being piloted / explored by a few individuals within the target group. |
| Walk | Key Adoption | REPLACE ME |
| Run | Full Adoption | REPLACE ME |
### Lens 5: Automation
`TO DO: write-up description of lens`
| Maturity | Heading | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Pre-Crawl | No Automation | REPLACE ME |
| Crawl | Experimental Automation | REPLACE ME |
| Walk | Primary Automation | REPLACE ME |
| Run | Full Automation | REPLACE ME |
